## Ciao 👋🏻 
I'm Naduni Madawala 

I’m a Cloud & SaaS Operations Engineer who enjoys working with cloud platforms,
DevOps tools, automation, and solving real-world production issues.

Here you’ll find my projects, experiments, and automation work related to
AWS, Azure, CI/CD pipelines, Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes.
I like learning by doing and improving things step by step.
